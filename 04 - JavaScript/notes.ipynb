    "# Javascript\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript was created in 1995 at [Netscape Communications](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Communications), at that time the most popular Internet browser. Initially, it was designed **to add interactivity to web pages**, and it quickly became an essential tool for web development. Over time, JavaScript's capabilities expanded beyond simple client-side scripting, with the introduction of frameworks and libraries, and the development of Node.js, which allowed it to run on servers as well. This made JavaScript **a full-stack language**, growing its popularity even further. Adopted by all major browsers, JavaScript became standardized under the [**ECMA specification**](https://tc39.es/ecma262/), ensuring uniformity and stability across different environments. Interestingly, despite its name, JavaScript has **nothing to do with Java**, the name was largely a marketing decision at the time to capitalize on Java growing popularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript is particularly well-suited for the Web of Things domain due to its versatility, real-time capabilities, and large ecosystem of libraries and tools. For instance, JavaScript can handle both front-end and back-end tasks, making it an ideal choice for handling data from various devices in a unified application. It can interact with hardware through APIs, process data efficiently, and integrate with cloud services, offering seamless communication between connected devices. Additionally, its asynchronous nature, supported by promises and async/await, is key in managing multiple IoT devices without blocking operations, making it a powerful tool for the Web of Things."

In JavaScript, error handling allows developers to catch and manage errors during runtime, preventing the application from crashing and providing users with meaningful feedback. JavaScript provides a robust system for error handling, relying heavily on the **try**, **catch**, and **finally** keywords to structure error management. The try block contains the code that might throw an error. If an error occurs within this block, JavaScript immediately jumps to the catch block, where the error can be handled. This allows the program to continue running without interruption. The catch block can access the error object, which contains details about the error, such as the message, stack trace, and error type. This makes it possible to handle different types of errors appropriately and provide relevant feedback. For instance, in a situation where we're trying to parse a string into JSON, a potential error could occur if the string is not valid JSON. Using a try...catch block, we can gracefully handle this:"

    "When we use new with a constructor, JavaScript does several things behind the scenes: it creates a new empty object, binds this to that object, and then runs the constructor function, allowing us to initialize properties and methods for the object. After the constructor function executes, it automatically returns the object created. The main difference with a factory function is that all instances created with a constructor are **linked to a prototype**. The prototype is a fundamental feature of the language **inheritance model**, it is an object from which an object inherits properties and methods. When we access a property or a method on an object, JavaScript looks for it on the object itself, and if it doesn’t find it there, it looks up the prototype. This allows objects to share functionality and reduces memory usage by avoiding duplication of methods across all instances of an object. When we use a constructor function, every instance created by that constructor shares a common prototype. The prototype is typically used to define methods or properties that should be available to all instances, ensuring that these methods aren't copied for each instance, but instead are shared across them:"

This results in **memory efficiency** because the method is not recreated for each instance of User. Instead, both objects look up the method on the prototype. Factory functions, instead, don’t rely on prototypes. Each time a factory function is called, it creates a completely new object that is not linked to any prototype. This means that each instance of an object created by a factory function is independent, and does not share methods via a prototype. However, factory functions provide more flexibility and control over object creation. We can encapsulate private data and logic within the factory, whereas constructors are more rigid and focus primarily on creating instances with shared prototypes. In summary, constructor functions are ideal when we want multiple instances to share common methods via the prototype, reducing memory usage and enabling inheritance. Factory functions provide more flexibility and are suitable when we need independent objects."

    "In JavaScript, all three paradigms (procedural, OOP and function) can be used together, depending on the needs of the application and the preferences of the developer. JavaScript is particularly well-suited to support these paradigms because it is flexible and allows developers to mix and match approaches within the same application. For example, we might write our data handling and transformations in a functional style, while organizing the logic for user interfaces and complex behaviors in an object-oriented manner. In general, the procedural approach is useful for small, straightforward scripts where we just need to process data in a linear fashion. Object-oriented programming shines in scenarios that require modeling complex entities and behaviors, particularly when dealing with large-scale applications. Functional programming, with its emphasis on immutability and pure functions, is ideal for cases that require high levels of concurrency, easy testing. Of course, both style (imperative and declarative) are often used together. For instance, we can write imperative code for certain low-level tasks that require explicit control, while using declarative methods like map, filter, and reduce for data manipulation. Let's considere an example to comperative the two styles (see *02.declatative_imperative.js*). Suppose to have a JSON string representing epresenting ancestral data.

    "\n",
    "**Regular expressions** (RegEx) are one of the more sophisticated tools available in JavaScript. They allow for pattern-based text searching, validation, and manipulation, making them incredibly useful for tasks such as form validation or extracting specific pieces of data from a string. This powerful feature helps developers write concise code for complex text processing, such as matching email formats, phone numbers, or even parsing log files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another fundamental feature of JavaScript is its ability to **interact with the browser** through the Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM provides a structured representation of the HTML page, allowing JavaScript to access and modify the content dynamically. Whether it’s adding new elements, changing existing ones, or updating the styling in response to user actions, the DOM provides the interface for JavaScript to shape the webpage in real time, contributing to the dynamic and interactive nature of modern websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Event handling** is another key feature in JavaScript, particularly when it comes to making webpages interactive. Events are actions triggered by users, such as clicking buttons, typing in input fields, or hovering over elements. JavaScript enables developers to listen for these events and execute specific functions in response. By adding event listeners to elements, developers can manage user interactions in a smooth and seamless way, providing feedback or triggering changes on the page without requiring a full page reload. we will consider this feature in the context of API development using Node.js.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Timers** in JavaScript offer additional flexibility by allowing the execution of functions after a specified delay or at regular intervals. This is particularly useful for tasks such as creating animations, auto-refreshing content, or handling timeouts in asynchronous operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, **handling forms** in JavaScript adds another layer of interactivity. Forms are essential for collecting user input, and JavaScript allows developers to validate and manipulate that data before it is submitted to the server. This can include checking for empty fields, ensuring proper formatting, or even providing real-time feedback as users complete forms.\n",
